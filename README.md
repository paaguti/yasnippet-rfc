Snippets to create RFCs with EMACS

This is a simple collection of snippets to create Internet Drafts, RFCs, etc. using Emacs. 

## Dependencies

* Emacs >= 24
* yasnippet

## Installation

* Install the yasnippet package in Emacs manually or using your favourite package manager (I used elpa)
* Include rfc-snippets.el into your .emacs.d/ directory and make sure init.el loads it
* Copy the snippet directory to .emacs.d/snippets/nxml-mode/rfc

There you are. Explore the snippets... They should appear as a separate submeny in the nxml-mode snippet menu

Enjoy and please, improve and contribute back :-)
